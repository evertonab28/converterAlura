# 📃 About 
This project was developed during Alura's Immersion Dev 7, where I made several significant improvements. Firstly, I introduced a home page that clearly displays all available converters. I also included a field so that the user can enter the value they want to convert, as well as buttons to perform the conversion and to clear the entered fields. As a class challenge, in addition to the dollar to Brazilian real converter, I implemented another one from euro to Brazilian real, and another spectacular one that converts distance from km to light years.
